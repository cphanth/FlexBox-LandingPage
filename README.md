# FlexBox-LandingPage
Building a landing page using FlexBox

Hi! I just completed creating a landing page using FlexBox while enrolled in Devslope's Beginner Full Stack Web Development course.
I've learned quite a bit through their program and look forward to learning more! I will likely try to build more landing pages just
to get more practice with using FlexBox.

This was also one of very few projects where I used JavaScript. In this project, JS is used for a neat navbar interaction in mobile.

I was also able to learn about styling my langing page so that it was mobile compatible with the use of media queries.

Through-out the project, I created the html code within WebStorm and used live edit in my web brower to adjust the styling which is
a great real-time editor (in-lieu of switching back and forth between web browser and text editor, refreshing and saving).

In the future I will attempt to write my own tutorials on creating a landing page with FlexBox!

Thanks for reading!
