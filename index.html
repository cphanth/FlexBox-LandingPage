                         I am learning full-stack web development through Devslopes! In this project, I am working
                        with Flexbox using WebStorm. I get to practice performing live edits in safari and then makes
                        changes to my code in WebStorm. I am also practicing html structures like creating wrappers
                        for my content for better access when styling in CSS.

                    <h3 class="text-header">Creating the NavBar</h3>
                    <div class="text-info">
                        I created a navbar class to contain another class of the actual links/list items,
                        which was designed as an unordered list. The unordered list also had an id property where ids
                        typically link JavaScript action into your HTML. Each list item needed to have an additional class in
                        order to style the text as well. To help the navbar look nicer with smaller screens, I used an
                        &lta onclick="toggleDropdown()"; return false;" href="javascript:void(0)"&gt. The JS function
                        is linked to a media query and concatenates a phrase onto a class name based on the size of the
                        media screen size. This helps the webpage become responsive with CSS styling within the media
                        query. I used the minified version of jQuery and nestled that above my JS source so that jQuery
                        script would run first prior to my code. I am still learning more about JS as I haven't had
                        much practice with it.

                    <h3 class="text-header">Ordering in Flexbox</h3>
                    <div class="text-info">
                        In working with styling in CSS, Flexbox makes it easy to order
                        my items using "order:" and assigning the value to the class
                        container of each item. For spacing of the items, I used "align-items"
                        to center my image and text vertically and "justify-content" to center
                        the items horizontally without affecting the style of the text itself.
                        A padding of 4rem 1rem gives space around each media-object class
                        container to look cleaner and less cluttered. I also learned that &ltp&gt
                        has an inherent display of block and &ltspan&gt has an inherent display of
                        in-line. That way, I could style the "CODESENSAI" in the navbar as such.

                    <h3 class="text-header">Styling the button</h3>
                    <div class="text-info">
                        For the button, I created a container class as a wrapper to hold the button.
                        I also created a class for the button object in order to style it in CSS. The default
                        HTML button styling looks pretty dull so I gave it some color, removed the border line,
                        added some padding to give the text some space from the border, and lastly created a
                        box-shadow and gave it a border radius to round the hard edges. Box-shadow numbers go in
                        this order: x-offset shadow, y-offset shadow, blurring, spreading of the shadow, color. The
                        x- and y-offsets are required values but blur and spread are optional. Spread refers to the size
                        of the shadow. While the color is optional (as the default color is the text color, it's
                        good practice to make it explicit in order to work across different web browsers. This color
                        is formatted in rgba(int, int, int, value between 0 and 1). The last value affects the
                        transparency of the color.

                    <div class="portfolio-text">
                        Here I created another section that holds portfolio boxes. The neat feature I learned was
                        working with hover actions. This box uses "transform" to scale up a specified size when the
                        cursor hovers over the object. To style the box itself, I used "transition: .2s ease-in-out;"
                        to get a smooth action.

                    <div class="portfolio-text">
                        Instead of creating to rows of portfolio objects, Flexbox has a cool feature that allows items
                        in-lin wrap around when confined within a max-width container. Then I used a "justify-content:
                        space around;" to spread space evenly between the portfolio objects.
